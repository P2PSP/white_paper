DBS provides ALM for unicast (UDP) environments. {\color{red} In this
  layer, peers must sent as many data to their contributors
  (neighbors) as they sent to them.} The media is sent by a server
${\cal O}$, called \emph{source}, at a (usually variable) bit-rate
which matches the bit-rate of the media, to a collection of
\emph{splitters} ${\cal S}=\{{\cal S}_0, \cdots, {\cal
  S}_{G-1}\}$. Each ${\cal S}_i$ splits the stream into a sequence of
\emph{chunks}, and relay them to ${\cal T}=\{{\cal T}_0,\cdots,{\cal
  T}_{G-1}\}$ \emph{teams} (one per splitter) of up to $N$
\emph{peers} $\{{\cal P}_0,\cdots,{\cal P}_{N-1}\}$, per team.
