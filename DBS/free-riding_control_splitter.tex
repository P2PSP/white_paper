In each team there are a set of $M\leq N$ \emph{monitors} ${\cal
M}^j_i\in {\cal T}^j$ (trusted peers whose behavior is predictable and
that are only known by the splitter), which complain to their splitter
${\cal S}^j$ when a chunk is lost. Lets suppose that chunk $c_x$ was
sent to ${\cal P}^j_k$. If ${\cal S}^j$ receives a
$[\mathtt{lost-c}~x]$ from each monitor of ${\cal T}_j$, and if
this happens during $L$ consecutive rounds, ${\cal S}_j$ considers
that ${\cal P}_i$ has leaved ${\cal T}_j$, and removes it from the
team.
