In each team there are a set of \emph{monitors} (trusted peers whose
behavior is predictable and that are only known by the splitter),
which complain to their splitter with a $[\mathtt{lost}
  \text{lost\_chunk\_number}]$ for each lost chunk. The splitter only
considers these type of messages if they come from a monitor.

If a peer $P_o$ accumulates more than $L^*$ losts in $R$ rounds, $P_o$
is removed from the splitter's list of peers. All peers do the same, but
in this case they also remove the selfish neighbors from the
$\text{forward}$ and $\text{pending}$ tables.

%Notice that $L$ will
%tend to be proportional to the number $M$ of monitors, especially if
%those cases where $P_o$ is a gone peer that was unable to transmit the
%$[\mathtt{goodbye}]$ messages.

\begin{notex}
This last functionality has not been implemented, at least, as it has
been explained here. The forget() thread is controlled by a timer, not
by a counter of rounds.
\end{notex}

%Peers also control that at least one chunk is received from a neighbor
%in each round.\footnote{Peers recognize that a new round has started
%  when a new chunk is received from the splitter.} If happens that a
%peer $P_x$ does not receives a chunk from peer $P_y$ between $D^*$
%consecutive rounds, $P_x$ removes $P_y$ of its forwaring table.
