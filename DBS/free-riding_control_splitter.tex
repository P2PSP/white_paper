In each team there are a set of \emph{monitors} (trusted peers whose
behavior is predictable and that are only known by the splitter),
which complain to their splitter with a $[\mathtt{lost}
  \text{lost\_chunk\_number}]$ for each lost chunk. The splitter only
considers these type of messages if they come from a monitor.

If a peer $P_o$ accumulates more than $L$ losts in $R$ rounds, $P_o$
is removed from the splitter's list of peers. Notice that $L$ is
proportional to the number $M$ of monitors, especially if $P_o$ is a
gone peer.

\begin{notex}
This last functionality has not been implemented, at least, as it has been explained here. The forget() thread is controlled by a timer, not by a counter of rounds.
