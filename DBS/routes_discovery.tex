% Routes Discovery and Topology Optimization

\label{sec:routes_discovery}

Chunks can be lost under bandwidth and buffering time constraints (a
chunk is lost when it is time to send it to the player, i.e. when it
is pointed by $p_p$, and the chunk has not been received). Because of
that when a peer realizes that a chunk pointed by $p_p$ has been lost,
nothing can be done to recover it, peers pre-fetch ``potentially
lost'' chunks at the buffer position $p_p+p_h$, where $p_h\geq 0$ is
the pre-feching horizon. Notice that if $p_h=0$, the pre-fetching is
disabled and only those chunks that really are lost will be
requested. On the contrary, the higher the $p_h$, the more agressive
the pre-fetching.

For each (potentially) lost chunk with number
$\text{lost\_chunk\_number}$, peers send a
$[\mathtt{request}~\text{lost\_chunk\_number}]$ message to a random
peer of the team. When a peer $P_i$ receives such message from a
$P_j$, $P_i$ adds $P_j$ to $\mathtt{forward}[P_k]$, where $P_k$ is the
origin peer of the chunk stored in the position
$(\text{lost\_chunk\_number}~\mathit{mod}~2B)$ of its buffer, this
chunks has been received. Otherwise, the request is ignored. Notice
that, although request messages are very short, they are an overhead.

When request messages are used, redundant routes can be created and
therefore, some chunks could be received more than once. Obviously,
this is also an overhead that must be minimized. To achieve this, the receiver of the prunning message counts the number of times that a origin peer has been pruned, and when this counters is higher than a threshold $T$ (the maximum number of generated duplicates), the corresponding entry in the $\text{forward}[]$ table is deleted.

Now, we can define more accurately the \gls{neighborhood-degree} (see
Sec.~\ref{sec:chunk_flooding}) as the number of different destination
peers for each possible origin that a peer forwards. For example, if a
peer $P_i$ forwards chunks from the origin $P_i$ to 10 neighbors, the
neighborhood degree of $P_i$ for the origin $P_i$ is 10, and if the
peer $P_i$ also forwards chunks from an origin $P_j$ to 5 neighbors,
the neighborhood degree of $P_i$ for the origin $P_j$ is 5.

Considering the rules described before, the neighborhood degrees of
peers can decrease or increase to optimize the topology of the
overlay, by minimizing $\Delta t_b$. An increment in the degree for the origin of a requested
chunk $\text{lost\_chunk\_number}$ in $P_i$ is produced when $P_i$
recives a $[\mathtt{request}~\text{lost\_chunk\_number}]$ from a peer
that is not a neighbor, yet. On the contrary, a decrement in the
degree for the origin of a pruned chunk
$\text{duplicate\_chunk\_index}$ in $P_i$ is produced when $P_i$
receives a $[\mathtt{prune}~\text{duplicate\_chunk\_index}]$ from a
neighbor peer, for that origin. In fact, the continued use of the
requesting and prunning messages produce in a peer $P_i$ that the list
$\text{forward}[P_i]$ gets shorter (smaller \gls{neighborhood-degree})
and new entries in the table $\text{forward}[]$ are created.
