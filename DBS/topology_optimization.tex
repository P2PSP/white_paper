The neighborhood degree can also grow. When a chunk is lost, the peer
requests to receive the rest of chunks from the corresponding origin
peer to a random peer of the team. If duplicates are generated, prune
messages will remove the slower routes from that origin peer,
generating that the most reliable (and possiblely faster) route to
endure. When this happens, the requesting peer will be added to
$\mathtt{forward}[]$ (and therefore, sooner or later to
$\mathtt{pending}[]$) table of the requested peer, increasing its
neighborhood degree.
