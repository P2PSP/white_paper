% Free-riding Control at peers

\label{sec:free_riding_control}

Peers check the sending \gls{activity} of the rest of peers of the
team, with the objective of stop sending chunks to selfish peers. Such
activities are represented by an array of counters, indexed by the
origin of the received chunks. For each chunk received by $P_i$ and
originated at $P_o$, $P_i$ increases $\mathtt{activity}[P_o]$. In each
new round (when a chunk is received from the splitter), $P_i$
decreases $\mathtt{activity}[P_o]\forall P_o\in T$, and if
$\mathtt{activity}[P_o]<L^*$ (in this case, $L^*$ is the maximum
allowed number of chunks that a peer can ``lost'' with other peer), no
more chunks nor control messages will be delivered to $P_o$. However,
notice that this last consequence can be reversed if $P_o$ resumes its
sending activity with $P_i$.
