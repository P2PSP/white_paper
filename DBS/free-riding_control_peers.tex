% Free-riding Control at peers

\label{sec:free_riding_control}

Peers update the \gls{activity} of the origin peer of each received
chunk, removing from their list of peers those whose activity falls
below of a threshold $L^+$. When the origin of the chunk is a peer of
the team, the activity counter is incremented by one. However, if the
origin is itself (i.e. once per round), the activity counter is
decreased by one, and all peers with an activity smaller than $L^+$
are ignored.
