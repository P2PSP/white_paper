DBS provides ALM for unicast (TCP/UDP) environments. The media is
received by a collection of
\emph{splitters} $\{S^1, \cdots, S^G\}$ from a streaming server $O$,
called \emph{source}, at a (usually variable) bit-rate which matches
the bit-rate of the media. Each $S^t$ splits the stream into a
sequence of \emph{chunks}, and relay them to different \emph{team} of
up to $N$ \emph{peers}. We define the set of teams as
$T=\{T^0, \cdots, T^G\}$, and the set of peers per (full) team
$T^t=\{P^t_1, \cdots, P^t_N\}$.


%${\cal T}=\{{\cal T}_0,\cdots,{\cal T}_{G-1}\}$ \emph{teams} (one per
%  splitter) of up to $N$
%\emph{peers} $\{{\cal P}_0,\cdots,{\cal P}_{N-1}\}$, per team.
