  Finished and implemented.

\acrshort{DBS} is the most basic set of rules. The rest of sets
extends or modify its functionality.

DBS provides \acrshort{ALM} of a \gls{media} \gls{stream} in an
\gls{unicast} environment. The media is sent by a streaming
\gls{server} (which is not related to P2PSP), and it
is received by a \gls{splitter}.~\note{(see Sec.~\ref{sec:LBS})}~The
splitter divides the stream into a sequence of \gls{chunk}s of data,
and relays them to a \gls{team} of peers, following a round-robing
schema. Each peer of a team gathers the chunks from the splitter and
the rest of peers of the team, and sends them to at least one
\gls{player}.\note{Peer should run even if no player(s) are connected
  to it.}

\begin{comment}
In single layered streams\footnote{Each layer of a
  scalable stream is received by a different peer attached to the same
  player capable or render scalable media.}, each peer is spawned by a
player (normal users should not run peers directly).
%This system has been described in Fig.~\ref{fig:DBS_system}.

/* quitar: We define the set of teams as
$\{T\}$,
%=\{T^1,\cdots,T^{|T|}\}$,
and enumerate the peers in the team $T$ as $T=\{P_1,\cdots,P_{|T|}\}$. */
