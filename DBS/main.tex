DBS provides ALM~\cite{banerjee2002scalable} of a media stream in
unicast environments~\cite{comer2003computer}. The media is sent by a
streaming server $O$, called \emph{source} (the nomenclature used for
describing DBS is shown in Table~\ref{tab:DBS_nomenclature}), and
received by a set of \emph{splitters} $\{S\}$.
%=\{S^1,\cdots,S^{|T|}\}$ , where $1\leq |T|\leq G$.
Each splitter $S$ divides the stream into a sequence of
\emph{chunks}, and relay them to its corresponding \emph{team} $T$,
where it can be up to $N$ \emph{peers}. We define the set of teams as
$\{T\}$,
%=\{T^1,\cdots,T^{|T|}\}$,
and enumerate the peers in the team $T$ as $T=\{P_1,\cdots,P_{|T|}\}$.

%As can be seen, we have ignored that
%more of one teams can be broadcasting the same media stream (most
%sources support concurrent receivers, and therefore, multiple
%splitters).

%Consequently, if more channels are needed,
%all these objects should be instantiated for each different channel
%(for example, there should be a different tracker for each
%channel). In P2PSP, a channel is the equivalent to a same concept, for
%example, in the DVB (Digital Video Broadcasting) system.
