DBS provides ALM~\cite{banerjee2002scalable} of a media stream in
unicast environments~\cite{comer2003computer}. The media is sent by a
streaming server, called \emph{source} (the nomenclature used for
describing DBS is shown in Table~\ref{tab:DBS_nomenclature}), and
received by a set of \emph{splitters}.  Each splitter divides the
stream into a sequence of \emph{chunks}, and relay them to its
corresponding \emph{team}, where it can be up to
$\mathtt{MaxNumPeers}$ \emph{peers}.

/* quitar: We define the set of teams as
$\{T\}$,
%=\{T^1,\cdots,T^{|T|}\}$,
and enumerate the peers in the team $T$ as $T=\{P_1,\cdots,P_{|T|}\}$. */
