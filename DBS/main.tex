DBS provides ALM~\cite{banerjee2002scalable} of a media stream in
unicast environments~\cite{comer2003computer}. The media is sent by a
streaming \emph{server}, and received by a \emph{splitter} \note{(see
  Sec.~\ref{sec:LBS})}. The splitter divides the stream into a
sequence of \emph{chunks} of data, and relay them to its \emph{team}
using a round-robing schema, where it can be up to $N^*$ \emph{peers}
(see Tab.~\ref{tab:DBS_nomenclature}). Each peer gathers the chunks
from the splitter and the rest of peers of the team, and sends them to
at least one \emph{player}\footnote{Peer should run even if no
  player(s) are connected to it.}.

\begin{comment}
In single layered streams\footnote{Each layer of a
  scalable stream is received by a different peer attached to the same
  player capable or render scalable media.}, each peer is spawned by a
player (normal users should not run peers directly).
%This system has been described in Fig.~\ref{fig:DBS_system}.

$\{T\}$,
