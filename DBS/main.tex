DBS provides ALM for unicast (UDP) environments. The media is sent by
a server ${\cal O}$, called \emph{source}, at a (usually variable)
bit-rate which matches the bit-rate of the media, to a collection of
\emph{splitters} ${\cal S}=\{{\cal S}_0, \cdots, {\cal
  S}_{G-1}\}$. Each ${\cal S}_i \in {\cal S}$ splits the stream into a
sequence of \emph{chunks}, and relay them to different \emph{team} of
up to $N$ \emph{peers}. We define the set of teams as ${\cal
  T}=\{{\cal T}_0,\cdots,{\cal T}_{G-1}\}$ and the set of peers per
team $T_j=\{{\cal P}^j_0,\cdots,{\cal P}^j_{N-1}\}$.


%${\cal T}=\{{\cal T}_0,\cdots,{\cal T}_{G-1}\}$ \emph{teams} (one per
%  splitter) of up to $N$
%\emph{peers} $\{{\cal P}_0,\cdots,{\cal P}_{N-1}\}$, per team.
