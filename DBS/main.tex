DBS provides ALM~\cite{banerjee2002scalable} of a media stream in
unicast environments~\cite{comer2003computer}. The media is sent by a
streaming server, called \emph{source} (the nomenclature used for
describing DBS is shown in Table~\ref{tab:DBS_nomenclature}), and
received by a \emph{splitter}. The splitter divides the stream into a
sequence of \emph{chunks}, and relay them to a \emph{team}, where it
can be up to $\mathtt{MaxNumPeers}$ \emph{peers}. Each peer gathers
the chunks from the splitter and the rest of peers of the team, and
sends them to a \emph{player}. In single layered streams\footnote{Each
layer of a scalable stream is received by a different peer attached to
the same player capable or render scalable media.}, each peer is
spawned by a player (normal users should not run peers directly).
%This system has been described in Fig.~\ref{fig:DBS_system}.

/* quitar: We define the set of teams as
$\{T\}$,
%=\{T^1,\cdots,T^{|T|}\}$,
and enumerate the peers in the team $T$ as $T=\{P_1,\cdots,P_{|T|}\}$. */
