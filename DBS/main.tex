DBS provides ALM~\cite{banerjee2002scalable} of a media stream in
unicast environments~\cite{comer2003computer}. The media is sent by a
streaming server, and received by a splitter\note{ (see
  Sec.~\ref{sec:STS})}. The splitter divides the stream into a
sequence of \emph{chunks}, and relay them to its team, where it can be
up to $N^*$ peers. Each peer gathers the chunks from the splitter and
the rest of peers of the team, and sends them to a player. In
Tab.~\ref{tab:DBS_nomenclature} the definitions used in
the DBS have been summarized.
\begin{comment}
In single layered streams\footnote{Each layer of a
  scalable stream is received by a different peer attached to the same
  player capable or render scalable media.}, each peer is spawned by a
player (normal users should not run peers directly).
%This system has been described in Fig.~\ref{fig:DBS_system}.

/* quitar: We define the set of teams as
$\{T\}$,
%=\{T^1,\cdots,T^{|T|}\}$,
and enumerate the peers in the team $T$ as $T=\{P_1,\cdots,P_{|T|}\}$. */
