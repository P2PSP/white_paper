DBS provides ALM~\cite{banerjee2002scalable} for unicast
environments~\cite{comer2003computer}. The media is sent by a
streaming server $O$, called \emph{source}, and received by a set
of \emph{splitters} $S=\{S^1,\cdots,S^{|T|}\}$, where $1\leq |T|\leq
G$. Each splitter $S^t$ divides the stream into a sequence
of \emph{chunks}, and relay them to its \emph{team} $T^t$, where it
can be up to $N$ \emph{peers}. We define the set of teams as
$T=\{T^1,\cdots,T^{|T|}\}$, and enumerate the peers in the team $T^t$
as $T^t=\{P^t_1,\cdots,P^t_{|T^t|}\}$.

%${\cal T}=\{{\cal T}_0,\cdots,{\cal T}_{G-1}\}$ \emph{teams} (one per
%  splitter) of up to $N$
%\emph{peers} $\{{\cal P}_0,\cdots,{\cal P}_{N-1}\}$, per team.
