DBS provides ALM for unicast (TCP/UDP) environments. The media is
received by a collection of
\emph{splitters} ${\cal S}=\{{\cal S}^0, \cdots, {\cal
  S}^{G-1}\}$ from a streaming server ${\cal O}$,
called \emph{source}, at a (usually variable) bit-rate which matches
the bit-rate of the media. Each ${\cal S}^i$ splits the
stream into a sequence of \emph{chunks}, and relay them to
different \emph{team} of up to $N$ \emph{peers}. We define the set of
teams as ${\cal T}=\{{\cal T}^0,\cdots,{\cal T}^{G-1}\}$ and the set
of peers per team $T^j=\{{\cal P}^j_0,\cdots,{\cal P}^j_{N-1}\}$.


%${\cal T}=\{{\cal T}_0,\cdots,{\cal T}_{G-1}\}$ \emph{teams} (one per
%  splitter) of up to $N$
%\emph{peers} $\{{\cal P}_0,\cdots,{\cal P}_{N-1}\}$, per team.
