\acrshort{DBS} is the most basic set of rules. The rest of sets extends or modify
its functionality.

DBS provides \acrshort{ALM} of a \gls{media} \gls{stream} in an
\gls{unicast} environment. The media is sent by a streaming
\gls{server} (which is an external P2PSP entity), and received by a
\gls{splitter}\note{(see Sec.~\ref{sec:LBS})}~. The splitter divides
the stream into a sequence of \gls{chunk}s of data, and relay them to
a \gls{team} of peers, following a round-robing schema. Each peer of a
team gathers the chunks from the splitter and the rest of peers of the
team, and sends them to at least one \gls{player}\note{Peer should
  run even if no player(s) are connected to it.}~.

\begin{comment}
In single layered streams\footnote{Each layer of a
  scalable stream is received by a different peer attached to the same
  player capable or render scalable media.}, each peer is spawned by a
player (normal users should not run peers directly).
%This system has been described in Fig.~\ref{fig:DBS_system}.

/* quitar: We define the set of teams as
$\{T\}$,
%=\{T^1,\cdots,T^{|T|}\}$,
and enumerate the peers in the team $T$ as $T=\{P_1,\cdots,P_{|T|}\}$. */
