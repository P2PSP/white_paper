Peer's life is described in Fig.~\ref{fig:peers_life}. Peers must: (1)
join a team (determined by the player) in order to access to the
contents broadcasted in such team, (2) buffer some chunks before
starting playing them and after that, and (3) keep buffering chunks
(and sending them to the player) until the media player quites.
