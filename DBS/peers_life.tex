Peer's life is simple: (1) buffer some chunks before starting playing
them and after that (2) keep buffering chunks until the media player
quites (usually, while the media stream has not finished). This
behavior has been described in Fig.~\ref{fig:peers_life}. Notice that,
because the chunks are not received in order, the first received chunk
not always will be the first chunk in the buffer.
