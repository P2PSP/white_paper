\subsubsection{Flooding order}
\label{dbs:flooding_order}
As an incentive mechanism~\cite{xu2006analysis}, peers relay received
chunks first to those peers that

%neighbors with lower chunk-debts.

\subsubsection{Team dynamics}
\label{dbs:team_dynamics}
${\cal P}_i$ adds to $N({\cal P}_i)$ those ${\cal P}_j$ that has sent
to ${\cal P}_i$ a chunk. If $N({\cal P}_i)>K$, periodically, ${\cal
  P}_i$ removes from $N({\cal P}_i)$ the peer with highest chunk-debt
and try to find in ${\cal T}_j\setminus N({\cal P}_i)$ a new peer using
$[\mathtt{hello}]$ messages.

Peers use a buffer $b$ of chunks to hide the jitter generated by the
physical network and the broadcasting protocol. When a peer receives
$C_i$, it performs
\begin{equation}
  b[i~\text{mod}~B] = c_i,
\end{equation}
where ``mod'' represents the modulo operator and $B$ the buffer size
(in chunks). Basically, the buffer represents a sliding window that
moves over the stream synchronizely with the playing because the the
player consumes the chunks at the same chunk-rate the source produces
them.

\begin{itemize}

\item In the P2PSP, only monitor peers complains about lost
  chunks. This means that if a chunk that has been retransmitted by a
  peer is lost, it will be only retransmitted to all the peers of the
  team if the destination is a monitor peer and there is a unique
  monitor peer in the team. On the other hand, if the lost chunk was
  traveling from the splitter to a peer, all monitor peers will
  complain and this chunk will be retransmitted to the complete
  team. Therefore, only massively loss chunks will be retransmitted in
  the P2PSP. However, notice that a isolated missing chunk will
  produce negligible artifacts in the playback of one peer. In the
  Chain model, the lost of a chunk is handled between neighbour peers
  which means that all lost blocks should be, a priori, recovered.

\subsubsection{Shortest path computation}
\label{dbs:chunk_routing}
\begin{figure}

  \caption{Shortest path computation.\label{fig:shortest_path_computation}}
\end{figure}
The shortest path distances among peers are determined by a variation
of the Bellman-Ford Algorithm~\cite{Bertsekas1987data} (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:shortest_path_computation}), where the cost of the
``links'' between neighbor peers is $1$. Neighbor peers interchange
two vectors $D[\cdot]$ (distance-to-peer) and $G[\cdot]$
(gateway-to-peer) and compute the shortest distances and the (peer)
gateways to (reach) the rest of peers of its team ${\cal T}_j$.

This algorithm is free of routing loops and is not suceptible of the
well known count-to-infinity problem, and therefore always converges
for static teams. These problems do not appear because the routes are 

Each peer ${\cal P}_k$ sends
its vector of distances $D[\forall {\cal P}_i\in T^*({\cal P}_k)]$ and
gateways $G[\forall {\cal P}_i\in T^*({\cal P}_k)]$ to each
neighbor. When this information is received, peers check if shorter
routes can be found to the rest of peers of the reachable team, and if
so, send these vectors again.

The Bellman-Ford algorithm is susceptible of routing loops and the
count-to-infinite problem.


% Hace falta saber desde dónde viene el chunk original (origin peer) y que todos los peers dispongan de los vector-distances de los peers vecinos. Los vector-ditances deben tener tantas entradas como peers existen en el team. Por tanto, cada peer almacena un número de vector-distances igual a su grado de conectividad.


% Supposing that the weight of links between neighbors is 1.
% ¿Cómo sabe un peer que él es el último?

\subsubsection{Generation of the routing tables}
Routing tables has as many entries as peers are in the team. The
routing table of a peer $P_i$ is a dictionary of pairs ($d(P_i, P_j)$,
$P_k$) indexed by the destination peer $P_j$ is a destination peer,
where $d(P_i, P_j)$ is the last measurement of the number of hops (in
peers) between $P_i$ and $P_j$, and $P_k\in N(P_i)$ is the 1-hop peer
that in the shortest-path between $P_i$ and $P_j$. Notice that if
$P_j==P_k$ then $d(P_i, P_j)==1$, which means that $P_i$ and $P_j$ are
directly ``connected''.

When a peer has updated its routing table, it is sent to their
neighbors pyggibacked on a \textsf{chunk} packet. When a peer receives
a routing table, it keeps a copy of it and updates its own routing
table with the new routing information using the Bellman-Ford
Algorithm~\cite{}. The peers have a copy of the routing table of its
neighbors to use it through the chunk routing process (see
Rule~\cite{the_routing_process}.
