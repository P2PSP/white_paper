% Joining the Team

\label{sec:joining}

After connecting with a splitter, incoming peers request (using a
reliable communication) to the splitter the current list of peers in
the team $T$. To minimize the \gls{joining-time}, the peer sends a
$[\mathtt{hello}]$ message to each other peer of the team, in parallel
with the reception of the list. When a peer of the team receives a
$[\mathtt{hello}]$, it adds the sender of the message to the team
list\footnote{Peers also updates their team list every time a chunk is
  received from a peer, incorporating the sender and the origin of the
  chunk.} and to a jagged array of peers called $\mathtt{f}[]$
\note{(see
  \href{https://github.com/P2PSP/simulator/blob/f0c73be1817e7d3b816cc61cd2c8e59b17f9a0e6/src/core/peer_dbs.py\#L491}{$\text{f[]}$
    in \texttt{peer.py}})}. If a peer $P_i$ has an entry
$\mathtt{f}[P_j]=\{P_k\}$, then each chunk received by $P_i$ and
originated at $P_j$ will be forwarded to $P_k$. When an incoming peer
$P_i$ has received the list of peers, its forwarding table has been
initialized to $\mathtt{f}[P_i]=\{T\setminus P_i\}$. Notice
that, as long as the forwarding table contains this information, all
the chunks received from the splitter will be forwarded to the rest of
the team, directly (in one single hop/chunk). So, in absence of
communication constraints, the team will be organized as a
full-connected overlay (see Fig.~\ref{fig:full}).

%), initializes
%the table $\mathrm{debt}[]$ (which stores the chunk debts between
%neighbor peers), and (3) sets the variable $\mathrm{neighbor}$ with an
%index to $\mathrm{f}[]$ (see
%Sec.~\ref{sec:chunk_DBS_processing}).

The splitter, in an infinite loop: (1) listens to the incoming peers,
(2) sends to them the list of peers of the team, (3) includes the
incoming peer to the list, and (4) send a chunk to each peer in its
list. Notice that only those peers that are in the list of peers of
the splitter are considered to be in the team served by such splitter.
