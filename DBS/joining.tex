% Joining the Team

\label{sec:joining}

After connecting with a splitter, incoming peers request (using a
reliable communication) to the splitter the current set of peers in
the team. To minimize the joining time, the peer sends a
$[\mathtt{hello}]$ message to each other peer of the team, in parallel
with the reception of the set. When a peer of the team receives a
$[\mathtt{hello}]$, it adds the sender of the message to a
\emph{table}\footnote{A structure which implements a random access
  efficiently.} of peers called $\mathtt{forward}[]$ \note{(see
  \href{https://github.com/P2PSP/simulator/blob/f0c73be1817e7d3b816cc61cd2c8e59b17f9a0e6/src/core/peer_dbs.py\#L491}{$\text{forward[]}$
    in \texttt{peer.py}})}. If a peer $P_i$ has an entry
$\mathtt{forward}[P_j]=P_k$, then each chunk received by $P_i$ and
originated at $P_j$ will be forwarded to $P_k$. When an incoming peer
$P_i$ has received the set of peers, its forwarding table has been
initialized to $\mathtt{forward}[P_i]=\{\text{team}\setminus
P_i\}$. Notice that, as long as the forwarding table contains this
information, all chunks received from the splitter will be forwarded
to the rest of the team, directly (in one protocol hop). So, in
absence of communication constraints, the team will be organized as a
full-connected overlay (see Fig.~\ref{fig:full_mesh}).

%), initializes
%the table $\mathrm{debt}[]$ (which stores the chunk debts between
%neighbor peers), and (3) sets the variable $\mathrm{neighbor}$ with an
%index to $\mathrm{forward}[]$ (see
%Sec.~\ref{sec:chunk_DBS_processing}).

The splitter, in an infinite loop: (1) listens to the incoming peers,
(2) sends to them the set of peers of the team, and (3) includes the
incoming peer to the set. Notice that only those peers that are in
the set of peers of the splitter are considered to be in the team
served by such splitter.
