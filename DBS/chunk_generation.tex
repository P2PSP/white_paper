\label{sec:chunk_generation}

The splitter divides the stream into chunks of data of constant
length, and sends exclusively each chunk to a different \emph{origin
peer}\footnote{In the route that a chunk follows though the team, the
origin peer of a chunk is first peer that receives that chunk.}, using
a round-robin schema (see Fig.~\ref{fig:chunk_generation}). Each chunk
is enumerated with an index $x$, conforming a message
$c_x=[x,\text{chunk}]$, where
$x=i \text{mod} \text{Splitter\_DBS.list\_of\_peers}.\text{length}()$.

We define a \emph{round} as the process of sending a (different) chunk
from the splitter to the same peer. Notice that the round-time is
variable, and depends on the number of peers in the team, the
chunk-size, and the average bit-rate of the media.

(in a team) as the time necessary to send two
consecutive chunks from the splitter (of such team) to the same peer,
using the round-robing. This time is variable and depends on $|T|$,
$C$, and the average bit-rate of the media, $A$.

The round-time is defined by:
\begin{equation}
  \cal{r} = \cal{c}N.
  \label{eq:round_time}
\end{equation}
For example, if we use only one team of $N=256$ peers, a chunk size
$C=1024$~bytes, and a video of $1$~Mb/s, the round time is
\begin{displaymath}
  \cal{r} = \frac{1024\frac{\text{bytes}}{\text{chunk}}\times
    8\frac{\text{bits}}{\text{byte}}}{10^6\frac{\text{bits}}{\text{second}}}\times
  256 \approx 2.1~\text{seconds}.
\end{displaymath}
