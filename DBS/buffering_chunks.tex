\label{sec:buffering_chunks}

In order to hide the jitter generated by the physical network and the
protocol itself, peers need to store the received chunks in a buffer
during a period of time, before sending them to a player. A chunk with
number $x$ is inserted in the position $(x~\mathit{mod}~2B)$ of the
buffer, where $B$ is the maximum number of chunks that the buffer can
store. In a peer's life, $B$ is a constant, but it is not compulsory
that all peers of a team use the same buffer size.

The buffer is implemented as a circular queue of $2B$ chunks, which is
filled up to only $B$ chunks during the \emph{buffering time} $t_B$
(which is the main part of the \emph{start-up time} that the users
experiment). Chunks with a higher number (newer chunks) are inserted
in the head of the buffer. The (received) chunk pointed by the tail of
the buffer is sent to the player. This action is carried out each time
a new chunk is received\footnote{DBS does not know nothing about the
content and therefore, about the chunk timming.}. Empty cells in the
buffer (caused by the chunks that have not been received on time) are
skipped until to find the next cell with content.

The buffering time determines how long the peers must wait for start
playing the chunks\footnote{A parameter that in last instance depends
  only on the user's preferences.} Considering that the chunks can be
lost in transit or delayed more than $B$ times of chunk, randomly, it
is difficult to determine, a priori, the optimal $t_B$. DBS peers
buffer a variable number of chunks that depends on the order in which
chunks are received. If $x_1$ is the (number of the) first received
chunk (the first chunk to be played), the buffering time finishes when
a chunk with number equal or greater than $x_{1+B}$ is
received.\footnote{Notice that all received chunks with an number
  smaller than $x_1$ will be discarded, and that during the buffering
  time, it can happens that some chunks are not received on
  time. Therefore, it does not make sense to wait for $B$ chunks
  before stopping the buffering process.} Lets analyze some
interesting cases.

Lets suppose that the first received chunk is $x_1$ and that the rest
of chunks of the buffer of size $B$ are received, being the chunk
$x_{1+B}$ the last (this is the ideal scenario). In this case, the
stream can be played without artifacts. Because the playing of the
chunks starts after the buffering process, the end-latency
experimented by users would be $T=Bt_C+L$, being $L$ the latency
generated by the physical transmission media (see
Tab.~\ref{tab:DBS_nomenclature}).

Lets imagine now one of the worst possible scenarios, in which after
receiving $x_1$ the chunk $x_{1+B}$ is received. In this case, the
chunks $x_2, \cdots x_{1+B-1}$ have been lost (or delayed too much) by
the physical transmission media or the transmission protocol, but
again (and considering $t_C$ constant), the buffering time is $t_B=Bt_C$
because the chunk $x_{1+B}$ was generated $B$ chunk times after
$x_1$. Therefore, in this case the end-latency is also $T=Bt_C+L$.

After considering these two extreme situations, we can conclude that
the end-latency does not depend on the loss chunk ratio during the
buffering time (always that this ratio is smaller than one), but only
on $B$, $t_C$ and $L$.

An heuristic that
works is the described in the Fig.~\ref{fig:DBS_peer_buffering}. As
can be seen, $\text{chunk\_to\_play}$ points to the first received
chunk, that not necessary is the received chunk with lower
index. After that, the
buffering finishes when a chunk with index $\text{chunk\_to\_play} +
\text{BUFFER\_SIZE}/2$ has been received.\footnote{This not means that
  $\text{BUFFER\_SIZE}/2$ chunks are available in the buffer.}
