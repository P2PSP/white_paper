\label{sec:chunk_buffering}
In order to hide the jitter generated by the physical network and the
protocol itself, peers need to store the received chunks in a buffer
before playing them. A chunk $c_x$ is inserted in the position
$(x \mathit{mod} B)$ of the buffer, where $B$ is the buffer size in
chunks.
