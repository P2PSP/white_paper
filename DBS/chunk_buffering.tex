In order to hide the jitter generated by the physical network and the
protocol itself, peers need to store the received chunks in a buffer
before playing them. A chunk $c_x$ is inserted in the position
$(x~\mathit{mod}~B)$ of the buffer, being $B$ the buffer size in
chunks and ``$\mathit{mod}$'' the modulo operator. A chunk is given as
lost when it is time to send it to the player and the chunk has not
been received.
