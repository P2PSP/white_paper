\label{sec:chunk_buffering}

In order to hide the jitter generated by the physical network and the
protocol itself, peers need to store the received chunks in a buffer
before playing them. A chunk $c_x$ is inserted in the position
$(x \mathit{mod} B)$ of the buffer, where $B$ is the buffer size in
chunks.

Fig.~\ref{fig:buffer_chunks} shows how peers buffer the chunks before
playing them. Notice that, because the chunks are not received in
order, the first received chunk not always will be the first chunk in
the buffer.
