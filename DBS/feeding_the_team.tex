% Feeding the Team

\label{sec:feeding_the_team}

The splitter divides the stream into chunks of constant length $C$
(\emph{chunk size}), and sends exclusively each chunk to a different
\emph{origin}\footnote{In the route that a chunk trances inside of the
  team, the origin peer of a chunk is first peer that receives that
  chunk, i.e. the peer selected by the splitter.} peer, using a
round-robin schema. Chunks are enumerated to distinguish them, and this
information is transmitted as a part of a chunk header.

We define a \emph{round} as the process of transmitting $N$ different
chunks from the splitter to a team of $N\leq N^*$ peers. Therefore,
for a team of size $N$, the \emph{round time} $t_R=Nt_C$. Notice that
$t_R$ is generally variable, and depends on the current number of
peers in the team ($N$), and the \emph{chunk time}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:chunk_time}
  t_C=\frac{C}{R}
\end{equation}
which depends on the chunk size $C$ and the average bit-rate of the
media stream $R$.

In DBS, all the peers of the team are origin of a different chunk, in
each round.

(in a team) as the time necessary to send two consecutive chunks from
  the splitter (of such team) to the same peer, using the
  round-robing. This time is variable and depends on $|T|$, $C$, and
  the average bit-rate of the media, $A$.

The round-time is defined by:
\begin{equation}
  \cal{r} = \cal{c}N.
  \label{eq:round_time}
\end{equation}
For example, if we use only one team of $N=256$ peers, a chunk size
$C=1024$~bytes, and a video of $1$~Mb/s, the round time is
\begin{displaymath}
  \cal{r} = \frac{1024\frac{\text{bytes}}{\text{chunk}}\times
    8\frac{\text{bits}}{\text{byte}}}{10^6\frac{\text{bits}}{\text{second}}}\times
  256 \approx 2.1~\text{seconds}.
\end{displaymath}
