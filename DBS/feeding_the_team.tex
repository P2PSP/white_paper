The splitter divides the stream into chunks of constant length, and
sends exclusively each chunk to a different \emph{origin
  peer}\footnote{In the route that a chunk follows though the team,
  the origin peer of a chunk is first peer that receives that chunk,
  i.e. the peer selected by the splitter.}, using a round-robin
schema. The teams are created with a least one monitor
peer\footnote{Usually, this peer is a monitor peer (see
  Sec.~\ref{sec:...}), because it can be used by the overlay
  administrator to monitorize the rendering of the stream.} that runs,
by default, in the same host that the splitter, and listens to the
port 9999. Chunks are enumerated to distinguish them at the peers.

We define a \emph{round} as the process of sending a (different) chunk
from the splitter to all the peers of the team. In other words, in a
round, all peers of the team should have received a different chunk
from the splitter. Notice that the round-time is variable, and depends
on the number of peers in the team, the chunk-size, and the average
bit-rate of the media.

The splitter remembers which chunk, of a list of the last $B$ chunks
transmitted to a peer of the team, was sent to each peer.

(in a team) as the time necessary to send two consecutive chunks from
  the splitter (of such team) to the same peer, using the
  round-robing. This time is variable and depends on $|T|$, $C$, and
  the average bit-rate of the media, $A$.

The round-time is defined by:
\begin{equation}
  \cal{r} = \cal{c}N.
  \label{eq:round_time}
\end{equation}
For example, if we use only one team of $N=256$ peers, a chunk size
$C=1024$~bytes, and a video of $1$~Mb/s, the round time is
\begin{displaymath}
  \cal{r} = \frac{1024\frac{\text{bytes}}{\text{chunk}}\times
    8\frac{\text{bits}}{\text{byte}}}{10^6\frac{\text{bits}}{\text{second}}}\times
  256 \approx 2.1~\text{seconds}.
\end{displaymath}
