The splitter divides the stream into chunks of data of constant
length, and sends exclusively each chunk to a different \emph{origin
  peer}\footnote{In the route that a chunk follows though the team,
  the origin peer of a chunk is first peer that receives that chunk.},
using a round-robin schema. The teams are created with a least one
peer\footnote{Usually, this peer is a monitor peer (see
  Sec.~\ref{sec:...}), because it can be used by the overlay
  administrator to monitorize the rendering of the stream.} that runs,
by default, in the same host that the splitter and listens to the port
9999. Chunks are enumerated to distinguish them at the peers. More
details about the implementation are available in
Fig.~\ref{fig:chunk_generation}.

We define a \emph{round} as the process of sending a (different) chunk
from the splitter to all the peers of the team. In other words, in a
round, all peers of the team should have received a different chunk
from the splitter. Notice that the round-time is variable, and depends
on the number of peers in the team, the chunk-size, and the average
bit-rate of the media.

\begin{comment}
(in a team) as the time necessary to send two
consecutive chunks from the splitter (of such team) to the same peer,
using the round-robing. This time is variable and depends on $|T|$,
$C$, and the average bit-rate of the media, $A$.

\begin{comment}
The round-time is defined by:
\begin{equation}
  \cal{r} = \cal{c}N.
  \label{eq:round_time}
\end{equation}
For example, if we use only one team of $N=256$ peers, a chunk size
$C=1024$~bytes, and a video of $1$~Mb/s, the round time is
\begin{displaymath}
  \cal{r} = \frac{1024\frac{\text{bytes}}{\text{chunk}}\times
    8\frac{\text{bits}}{\text{byte}}}{10^6\frac{\text{bits}}{\text{second}}}\times
  256 \approx 2.1~\text{seconds}.
\end{displaymath}
