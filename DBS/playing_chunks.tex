\label{sec:playing_chunks}

After buffering, the received chunks are sent to the player using a
reliable channel, on demand, starting at the chunk pointed by
$\text{chunk\_to\_play}$, which is incremented one-by-one. Those
chunks that have not been received at the time of sending them to the
player are considered as lost.
