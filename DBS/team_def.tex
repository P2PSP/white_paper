A team is a set of one or more peers that share the same stream. By
definition, in a team of size one (the corresponding splitter is
considered out of the team if feeds), the only peer is known as a
\emph{monitor} peer, and in a team with more than one peer, at least
one of them must be a monitor peer. Monitors are instantiated by the
team administrator to monitorize different aspects of the
broadcasting, such as, the expected quality of the rendered video at
the peers or the expected average end-user latency.
