% Team Definition

\label{sec:team_def}

For the splitter, a team is a set of one or more peers (referenced by
their end-points) that share the same stream. By definition, in a team
of size one (the corresponding splitter is considered out of the team
that it feeds), the only peer is known as a \gls{monitor} peer, and in
a team with more than one peer, at least one of them must be a
monitor. Monitors are instantiated by the overlay administrator to
check different aspects of the broadcasting, such as, the quality of
the rendered video at the peers or the end-user latency.

The number of peers (normal peers and monitors) in a team has a
maximum $N^*$ (see Tab.~\ref{tab:DBS_nomenclature}). This parameter
has an impact on the latency of the protocol (see
Sec.~\ref{sec:buffering_chunks}), and usually is defined by the
administrator of the overlay.
