% Team Definition

\label{sec:team_def}

A team is a set of one or more peers (referenced by their end-points)
that share the same stream. By definition, in a team at least one peer
is a \gls{monitor}. Monitors are deployed by the overlay administrator
to check different aspects of the broadcasting, such as, the expected
quality of the rendered video at the peers or the estimated latency.

The number of peers (normal peers and monitors) in a team has a
maximum $N^*$ (see Tab.~\ref{tab:DBS_nomenclature}). This parameter
has an significative impact on the maximum latency of the protocol (see
Sec.~\ref{sec:buffering_chunks}), and is usually defined by the
administrator of the overlay.
