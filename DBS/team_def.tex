% Team Definition

\label{sec:team_def}

A team is a set of one or more peers (referenced by their end-points)
that share the same stream. By definition, in a team of size one (the
corresponding splitter is considered out of the team if feeds), the
only peer is known as a \emph{monitor peer}, and in a team with more
than one peer, at least one of them must be a monitor, which
are instantiated by the overlay administrator to monitorize different
aspects of the broadcasting, such as, the expected quality of the
rendered video at the peers or the expected average end-user latency.

The number of peers (normal peers and monitors) in a team has a
maximum $N^*$ (see Tab.~\ref{tab:DBS_nomenclature}). This parameter
has a impact on the latency of the protocol (see
Sec.~\ref{sec:buffering_chunks}) and usually is defined by the
administrator of the overlay.
