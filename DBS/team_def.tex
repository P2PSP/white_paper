A team is a set of one or more peers that share the same stream. By
definition, in a team of size one, the only peer is known as a
\emph{monitor} peer. In a team with more than one peer, at least one
of them must be a monitor peer. Monitor peers are instantiated by the
overlay administrator to monitorize different aspects of the
broadcasting, such as, the quality of the rendering of the stream.
