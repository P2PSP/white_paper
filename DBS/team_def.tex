% Team Definition

\label{sec:team_def}

A team is a set of one or more peers (referenced by their end-points)
that share the same stream. By definition, in a team at least one peer
is a \gls{monitor} (peer). Monitors are deployed by the overlay
administrator to check different aspects of the broadcasting, such as,
the expeted quality of the rendered video at the peers or the
estimated end-user latency.

The number of peers (normal peers and monitors) in a team has a
maximum $N^*$ (see Tab.~\ref{tab:DBS_nomenclature}). This parameter
has an significative impact on the maximum latency of the protocol (see
Sec.~\ref{sec:buffering_chunks}), and is usually defined by the
administrator of the overlay.
