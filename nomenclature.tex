The nomenclature used for describing P2PSP is shown in
Table~\ref{tab:nomenclature}. In this documentation, only one media
channel has been considered, therefore, if more channels are needed,
all these objects should be instantiated for each different channel
(for example, there should be a different tracker for each
channel). In P2PSP, a channel is the equivalent to a same concept, for
example, in the DVB (Digital Video Broadcasting) system.
