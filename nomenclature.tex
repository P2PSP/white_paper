The nomenclature used for describing P2PSP is shown in
Table~\ref{tab:nomenclature}. In this documentation, only one media
channel has been considered, which basically means that all these
objects should be instantiated for each different channel (for
example, there should be a different tracker for each media
channel). In P2PSP, a channel is the equivalent to a same concept, for
example, in the DVB (Digital Video Broadcasting) system.
