In each round, peers check if a chunk have been received from the rest
of peers of the team (${\cal P}_k\in {\cal T}_j)$). If not, peers send
a $[\mathtt{not~prune}~{\cal P}_i]$ to one or more (possibly
to the rest of) peers of the team, where ${\cal P}_i$ is the origin peer
of the missing chunk. At this point, the process continues as
described in Section~\ref{dbs:chunk_flooding}.

\begin{comment}
For each ${\cal P}_k\in N({\cal P}_i)$, ${\cal P}_i$ checks if a chunk
has been received from ${\cal P}_k$. If ${\cal P}_i$ detects that
${\cal P}_k$ has not sent a chunk to it during $L$ consecutive rounds,
performs $N({\cal P}_i) = N({\cal P}_i)\setminus{\cal P}_k$, and stops
sending to ${\cal P}_k$ more chunks.

computes a
``chunk-debt'', denoted by $d({\cal P}_k)$, that is incremented each
time a chunk is received from ${\cal P}_k$ and decremented each time a
chunk is sent to ${\cal P}_k$. If ${\cal P}_i$ verifies that $d({\cal
  P}_k)>D$ (the maximum debt), then ${\cal P}_i$ considers that ${\cal
  P}_k$ is unable to communicate with it, performs $N({\cal P}_i) =
N({\cal P}_i)\setminus{\cal P}_k$, and stops sending to ${\cal P}_k$
more chunks.
