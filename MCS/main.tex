When using MDC~\cite{baccichet2007content}, SVC~\cite{chu2009auction},
or for emulating the CS model, it can be interesting for peers to
belong to more than one team. To implement MCS, peers must replicate
the P2PSP modules (DBS at least) for each team (channel), except the
buffer.

The use of MDC is trivial: the higher the number received descriptions
(channels), even partially, the higher the quality of the
playback. However, when transmitting SVC media, peers should
prioritize the reception of the most important layers. Finally, a
pure CS service could be provided if the corresponding splitter
announces one empty team and sends each chunk so many times as teams
(with one peer/team) there are.
