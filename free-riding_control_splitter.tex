In each team there are a set of peer \emph{monitors} (trusted peers
whose behavior is predictable), which complain to their splitter when
a chunk is lost. Lets suppose that chunk $c_x$ was sent to ${\cal
  P}_i\in {\cal T}_j$. If ${\cal S}_j$ receives a
$[\mathtt{lost\_chunk}~x]$ from each monitor of ${\cal T}_j$, and if
this happens during $L$ consecutive rounds, ${\cal S}_j$ considers
that ${\cal P}_i$ has leaved ${\cal T}_j$, and removes it from the
team.
