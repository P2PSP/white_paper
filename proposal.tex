\section{P2PSP (Peer-to-Peer Straightforwad Protocol}
\label{sec:proposal}

P2PSP provides broadcasting of media on the Internet. 
Conceptually, P2PSP is organized in sets of rules
%(\emph{sets of rules} in LP2PLS's jargon).
Only the most basic set (DBS) is the only compulsory one. The rest of
sets extend or modify the behevior of DBS, when applicable.

%For now, our discussion will be restricted to the case $G=1$ (we will
%suppose that there is only one team).

%Let $N({\cal P}_i^j)$ denote the neighborhood of peer ${\cal
%  P}_i^j$. It holds that the number of neighbors $|N({\cal
%  P}_i^j)|\leq k; \forall i$, with $k$ the degree of team ${\cal P}^j;
%\forall j$.

% If a node detects that a chunk will be missing with a high
% probability (the distance with the last played chunk is smaller than
% a minimum threshold), the peer can request explicitally that chunk
% to all its neighbors. Only the neighbors that have the lost chunk in
% that moment will reply (the requests are not queued). Thinking if is
% a good idea ... because it could be used for an attacker to collapse
% their neighbors.
