P2PSP (see \url{https://p2psp.github.io}) is an application-layer
protocol that provides real-time broadcasting, also known as
Application Layer Multicast (ALM), of media on the Internet. As in
many other P2P protocols, peers collaborate to diseminate the media
stream that is generated by a single source, minimizing the latency
and the protocol overhead. P2PSP has a modular design organized
in \emph{sets of rules}, where each module is especialzed in
implementing a different functionality.
