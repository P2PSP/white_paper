P2PSP (\url{https://p2psp.github.io}) is an application-layer protocol
that provides real-time broadcasting, also known as Application Layer
Multicast (ALM), of a media stream on the Internet. Peers collaborate
to diseminate the stream that is generated by a single source,
minimizing the latency and the protocol overhead. P2PSP overlays are
push-based (topology-driven) meshes. To minimize the transmission
latency, P2PSP establishes a communication between nearby peers, and
chunks of data are flooded without explicit requests. P2PSP has a
modular design organized in \emph{sets of rules}, where each module is
especialized in implementing a different functionality (use of native
IPM (IP Multicast), NAT traversal, etc.).
