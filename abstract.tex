P2PSP (\url{https://p2psp.github.io}) is an application-layer protocol
that provides real-time broadcasting of media streams on the
Internet. Peers collaborate to diseminate the stream that is generated
by a single source, generating a controlled latency and protocol
overhead. P2PSP overlays (\emph{teams}) are push-based (topology-driven)
dynamic meshes. The chunks of data are forwarded without explicit
requests, using a set of dynamic routes, that except in the case of
losing chunks, show a maximum bounded latency, defined by the overlay
users.
