P2PSP (\url{https://p2psp.github.io}) is an application-layer protocol
that provides real-time broadcasting, also known as Application Layer
Multicast (ALM), of a media stream on the Internet. Peers collaborate
to diseminate the stream that is generated by a single source,
generating a low latency and protocol overhead. P2PSP overlays (teams)
are push-based (topology-driven) dynamic meshes. To reduce the
transmission latency, P2PSP establishes a communication between the
nearby peers (using as distance between the peers the network latency
between them), and the chunks of data are forwarded by the peers
without explicit requests, generating self-organized teams that adapt
to changes of the network and peers performance.
