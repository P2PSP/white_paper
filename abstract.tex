% Abstract

P2PSP (Peer-to-Peer Straighforward Protocol,
\url{https://p2psp.github.io}) is an application-layer multicast
protocol that provides real-time broadcasting of media streams. The
streams are generated by a single source (which controls the data flow
of the system), split in chunks, and transmitted to the P2P overlay,
in streaming. The topology of the overlay is dynamic and adapted to
the requirements of the physical topology and transmission times. The
buffering time (start-up delay) at peers is proportional to the
maximum number of peers in the P2P overlay. In absence of connectivity
restrictions (such as the imposed by NATs) and selfish peers, all
peers have a I/O ratio close to 1, although this ratio can be
controlled for each peer. P2PSP can use unicast and IPM (IP Multicast)
communications, when available.
