% Abstract

\href{https://p2psp.github.io}{P2PSP (Peer-to-Peer Straighforward
  Protocol)} is an application-layer multicast protocol that provides
real-time broadcasting of media streams in the Internet. The peers
relay the stream split into chunks, using an UDP push communication
model. The data flow is controlled by the source(s) of the stream, and
the peers use a congestion control method based on the relaying of
chunks, only when chunks are received. The topology of the overlay is
dynamic and adapts to the requirements of the physical topology and
startup latency required, which is proportional to the maximum number
of peers in the P2P overlay. In absence of connectivity restrictions
(such as the imposed by NATs) and selfish peers, all peers have an
input/output ratio close to 1. P2PSP can use IP Multicast
communications, when available.
