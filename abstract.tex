P2PSP (\url{https://p2psp.github.io}) is an application-layer protocol
that provides real-time broadcasting, also known as Application Layer
Multicast (ALM), of a media stream on the Internet. Peers collaborate
to diseminate the stream that is generated by a single source,
minimizing the latency. P2PSP overlays are push-based
(topology-driven) meshes. To minimize the transmission latency, P2PSP
establishes a communication between nearby peers, and chunks of data
are flooded without explicit requests, reducing thus also the protocol
overhead. P2PSP has a modular design organized in \emph{sets of
rules}, where each module is especialized in implementing different
functionalities.
