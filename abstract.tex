% Abstract

P2PSP (\url{https://p2psp.github.io}) is an application-layer protocol
that provides real-time broadcasting of media streams on the
Internet. P2PSP overlays are topology-driven dynamic meshes of peers
that collaborate to diseminate the stream generated by a single
source. The chunks of data are forwarded without explicit requests
(P2PSP is a push-based protocol), trying to minimize the transmission
latency. By means of controlling the buffer size at peers, users can
bound the start-up delay, that can be adapted to the latency of the
network and the protocol to keep the chunk loss ratio below of
acceptable values. P2PSP is composed by a collection of set of
rules. By selecting which sets of rules are used, administrators can
configure the functionality of P2PSP overlays, taking advantage of
facilities such as using IP multicast, fighting selfish peers, or
handling peers behind firewalls/NATs with reduced connectivity.
