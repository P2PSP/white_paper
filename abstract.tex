% Abstract

P2PSP (\url{https://p2psp.github.io}) is an application-layer protocol
that provides real-time broadcasting of media streams. Peers receive
the stream generated by one or more media sources and share it,
splitted in chunks. The QoS provided can be dynamically controlled,
adding and removing media sources. The peers are organized in so many
unbounded-degree trees as peers there exist in the overlay. The trees
are dynamic and minimize the transmission delay. The startup time
experimented by the users depends mainly on the maximum expected size
of the overlay. Polite churn does not genrerate a loss of
chunks. Unpolite (unexpected) churn produce a loss, but the number of
lost chunks is bounded, and they are spread along the time and all
peers. Selfish peers are automatically isolated and rejected. Peers
with reduced connectivity (firewalls/NATs) can participate. If native
IP multicast is avaliable, peers can use it. All such functionality
has been organized into a number of set of rules that can be enabled
and disabled.
