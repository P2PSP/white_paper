% Abstract

P2PSP (\url{https://p2psp.github.io}) is an application-layer
multicast protocol that provides real-time broadcasting of media
streams. Peers receive the stream generated by one or more media
sources and share it, splitted in chunks (peers do not parse the
stream). The QoS provided can be dynamically controlled, by adding and
removing media sources. The peers are organized in so many
unbounded-degree trees as peers there exist in the overlay. The trees
are dynamic, and their topology try to minimize the transmission
delay. The startup time experimented by the users depends mainly on
the maximum expected size of the overlay. Polite churn does not
genrerate a loss of chunks. Unpolite (unexpected) churn produce a
loss, but the number of lost chunks is bounded, and they are spread
along the time and all peers. Selfish peers are automatically isolated
and rejected. All peers contribute with a I/O ratio of 1, but it is
also possible to accomodate peers with connectivity restrictions
(firewalls/NATs). If native IP multicast is avaliable, peers can use
it. All these functionalities have been organized into a number of set
of rules that can be enabled and disabled depending on the
requirements.
