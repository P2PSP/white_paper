P2PSP (\url{https://p2psp.github.io}) is an application-layer protocol
that provides real-time broadcasting of media streams on the
Internet. P2PSP overlays are topology-driven dynamic meshes of peers
that collaborate to diseminate the stream generated by a single
source. The chunks of data are forwarded without explicit requests
(push-based protocol), trying to minimize the transmission
latency. Defining the buffer size, the user can control the start-up
delay, that can be adapted to the congestion of the network to keep
the chunk loss ratio below of an expected value. Using a collection of
sets of rules, administrators can configure the functionality of a
P2PSP overlays, taking advantage of facilities such as IP multicast or
adapting to the presence of selfish peers or peers behind
firewalls/NATs with reduced connectivity.
