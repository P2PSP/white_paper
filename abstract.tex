P2PSP (\url{https://p2psp.github.io}) is an application-layer protocol
that provides real-time broadcasting, also known as Application Layer
Multicast (ALM), of a media stream on the Internet. Peers collaborate
to diseminate the stream that is generated by a single source,
generating a low latency and protocol overhead. P2PSP overlays are
push-based (topology-driven) meshes. To reduce the transmission
latency, P2PSP establishes a communication between the nearby peers
(using as distance between the peers the network latency between
them), and the chunks of data are flooded without explicit
requests.
