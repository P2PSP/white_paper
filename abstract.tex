% Abstract

P2PSP (Peer-to-Peer Straighforward Protocol,
\url{https://p2psp.github.io}) is an application-layer multicast
protocol that provides real-time broadcasting of media streams. The
streams are split in chunks and pushed over unbounded-degree trees
whose topology minimizes the transmission time, sending the chunks at
the average bit-rate of the streams. The buffering time (start-up
delay) at peers is bounded and proportional to the maximum number of
peers in the P2P overlay. Announced churn does not generate a loss of
chunks. Impolite (unannouced) churn can produce a loss, but the number
of lost chunks is bounded, and they are spread along the time and
among remaining peers. In absence of connectivity restrictions
(firewalls/NATs), all peers can be forced to contribute with a I/O
ratio close to 1. However, it is also possible to accommodate
``constrained''/selfish peers thanks to the (optional) generosity of
the rest. Peers can use native IP multicast where available,
minimizing the transmission time. All these functionalities have been
organized into a number of set of rules that can be enabled and
disabled depending on the requirements.
