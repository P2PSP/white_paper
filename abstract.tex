% Abstract

P2PSP (\url{https://p2psp.github.io}) is an application-layer
multicast protocol that provides real-time broadcasting of media
streams. Peers receive the stream generated by one or more media
sources and share it, split in chunks. The peers are organized in
so many unbounded-degree trees as peers there exist in the
overlay. The trees are dynamic, and their topology try to minimize the
transmission delay. The start-up time experimented by the users depends
mainly on the maximum expected size of the overlay. The QoS provided
can be dynamically controlled by adding and removing media
sources. Polite churn does not generate a loss of chunks. \leo{Impolite}
(unexpected) churn produce a loss, but the number of lost chunks is
bounded, and they are spread along the time and \st{all} \leo{among remaining} peers. Selfish
peers are automatically isolated and rejected. All peers contribute
with a I/O ratio of 1, but it is also possible to accommodate peers
with connectivity restrictions (firewalls/NATs). Peers can use native IP
multicast where available. All these functionalities
have been organized into a number of set of rules that can be enabled
and disabled depending on the requirements.
