In order to hide the jitter generated by the physical network and
P2PSP, peers store the received chunks before playing them. A chunk
$c_x$ is inserted in the position $(x~\mathit{mod}~B)$ of the buffer,
being $B$ the buffer size in chunks and ``$\mathit{mod}$'' the modulo
operator. A chunk is given by lost when it is time to send it to the
player and the chunk has not been received.
